    <h1>Adejubu Sunday | WDD 130</h1>
    <img src="images/Sunday-profile.png" alt="Hello, my name is Adejubu Sunday" width="200">
    <p>Hello! I'm Adejubu Sunday from Abuja, Nigeria. I'm passionate about video games, coding, and exploring new technologies. Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in software development through the BYU-Idaho Online program, and I'm enrolled in my first certificate course, Web and Computer Programming.

      As a return missionary, I had the privilege of serving in two different missions. Initially called to the Nigeria Port Harcourt Mission, I was later transferred to the newly created Nigeria Owerri Mission after a year.
      
      I'm happily married with three wonderful kids and currently serve as a Stake Technology Specialist and Assistant Stake Clerk in the Lugbe Abuja Nigeria Stake.</p>

    <h2>Nigeria</h2>

    <p>Nigeria, often referred to as the "Giant of Africa," is the most populous country on the African continent, with over 200 million people and more than 250 ethnic groups. Located in West Africa, it borders countries like Benin, Niger, Chad, and Cameroon, and has a diverse landscape ranging from tropical rainforests in the south to savannah and arid areas in the north.
      Historically, Nigeria was home to powerful ancient kingdoms, such as the Nok, Hausa, Benin, and Yoruba civilizations, which thrived long before European colonization. In 1960, Nigeria gained independence from British rule and has since become one of Africa's leading economies, primarily due to its large oil reserves.
      Nigeria is also known for its vibrant culture, music, and arts, especially through Afrobeat, popularized worldwide by musicians like Fela Kuti. With cities like Lagos, a bustling metropolis known for its nightlife and industry, and Abuja, the capital, Nigeria is a dynamic nation that blends tradition and modernity. The country is famous for its rich cuisine, diverse languages, and festivals, celebrating both its traditional heritage and contemporary innovations.
